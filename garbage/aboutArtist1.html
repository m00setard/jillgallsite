            <p>
                Jill has been painting from the early 1980’s and has since won many awards in that time.
                During that time‚ the Herald Sun Outdoor Art Show which was held annually‚ saw many of her 
                Melbourne Tram paintings going overseas‚ especially to the U.K., U.S.A., and China.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise her seascapes and many of her Lighthouse scenes have won her many awards‚ and have been sought by galleries. 
                Jill enjoys her painting‚ and prefers to create movement in her pictures giving them the feeling of being on the spot. 
                One could almost feel the sea spray!

            <p>
                Jill has a wide interest in painting pictures that challenge her‚ and her versatility in any subjects proves itself.
